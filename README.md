# Vision-based-GeoSpatial-Project
Vision-based Geospatial project that we developed in OpenCV, Eclipse, MingW and C++ as programming language. It was is a teamwork of 2 people for our final year project at ESIGELEC.

The Vision Based Geospatial Information System is a computer application system that is developed to identify the tentative geo-location of an image. It helps user to find the GPS coordinates (longitude & latitude) by matching maximum key points of a reference image with an image in the dataset. This application shows us the matching key points, longitude, and latitude of each and every images that are being compared with the reference image. On the basis of matching maximum number of key points, it stores the maximum key points matched image to the output folder.
